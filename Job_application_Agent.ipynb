    "# Overview of the Agents Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### ## The Agents: Your Specialist Team\n",
    "\n",
    "This crew is composed of four agents, each with a distinct role in the job application process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`researcher` (Tech Job Researcher):** This agent's only job is to analyze the provided job posting. It uses its search and scrape tools to extract all the key requirements, such as necessary skills, qualifications, and years of experience, that the employer is looking for.\n",
    "* **`profiler` (Personal Profiler for Engineers):** This agent focuses on the job applicant. It takes the applicant's information, like a GitHub profile and a personal write-up, and uses its tools to create a comprehensive professional profile. This includes a list of skills, project experiences, and contributions.\n",
    "* **`resume_strategist` (Resume Strategist for Engineers):** This is the resume writer. Its role is to take the output from the first two agents (the job requirements and the applicant's profile) and rewrite the resume. Its goal is to highlight the applicant's most relevant skills and experiences to perfectly match what the job posting is asking for.\n",
    "* **`interview_preparer` (Engineering Interview Preparer):** This is the final agent in the chain. It takes the tailored resume and the original job requirements to create a list of potential interview questions and key talking points. This prepares the candidate to confidently discuss how their skills and experience align with the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ## The Tasks: The Step-by-Step Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent is assigned a specific task that defines its work for a given run of the crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`research_task`:** Assigned to the `researcher`, this task's objective is to analyze the job posting URL and produce a structured list of all the job requirements. This task runs asynchronously.\n",
    "* **`profile_task`:** Assigned to the `profiler`, this task's goal is to analyze the applicant's provided GitHub URL and personal write-up to create a detailed professional profile. This task also runs asynchronously.\n",
    "* **`resume_strategy_task`:** Assigned to the `resume_strategist`, this task is dependent on the completion of the first two tasks, as specified by `context=[research_task, profile_task]`. It instructs the agent to rewrite the applicant's resume to align with the job requirements and saves the output to a file named `tailored_resume.md`.\n",
    "* **`interview_preparation_task`:** Assigned to the `interview_preparer`, this is the final task. It depends on the completion of the previous three tasks (`context=[research_task, profile_task, resume_strategy_task]`). It instructs the agent to create interview questions and talking points based on all the information gathered and saves the result to a file named `interview_materials.md`."

    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** To read the entire content of a specific local file.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### ## `ScrapeWebsiteTool` üï∏Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** To extract all the text content from a given webpage URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when an agent needs to analyze the information on a specific webpage, like a job posting or a company's \"About Us\" page, without needing to perform a general web search.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### ## `MDXSearchTool` üîç\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** To perform a semantic search *within* a Markdown (`.md` or `.mdx`) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of reading the whole file, this tool allows an agent to find the most relevant sections of a document based on the meaning of a query. For example, it can search a resume file for \"experience with Python\" and find the most relevant job descriptions, even if they don't use those exact words.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### ## `SerperDevTool` üåê\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** To perform a real-time Google search and get a list of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a general web search tool. Agents use it to find current information, news, or articles about a company, person, or topic when they don't have a specific URL to scrape."
